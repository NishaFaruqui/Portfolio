<b> Intro<br /><br />

by: Reyna Biddy<br /><br /></b>


My condolences to anyone who has ever lost me </br>
And, to anyone who got lost in me</br>
Or, to anyone who ever felt they took a loss with me</br>
My apologies for the misunderstanding or the lack thereof</br>
I'm sorry you missed the God in me</br>
And I'm sorry you missed the light</br>
I'm sorry you forgot the way I arose like the moon</br>
Night after night with the burden to forgive</br>
Eager to feed you everything</br>
See, I'm a holy woman</br>
I know what it's like to give life to a being without ever needing to press skin against one another</br>
I've practiced how to hold my tongue long enough</br>
I'm afraid I forgot to say goodbye</br>
I'm afraid you're under the impression</br>
That I was made to please you</br>
I was under the impression you understood me better</br>
The truth is, I'm a superwoman</br>
And some days I'm an angry woman</br>
And some days I'm a crazy woman</br>
For still waiting, for still loving harder even if I'm aching</br>
For still trusting that I'm still worth the most</br>
For still searching for someone to understand me better
